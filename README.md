## Problem description

## Initial plan
- Phase 1
  - Get familiar with Monai by classifing MedNIST data using deep learning. Comparison between two or more deep learning methods for 3D classification of the six 3D datasets. 
  - Investigate tools network visualisation e.g. GradCAM
  - Apply the network visualisation to the MedNIST models
  
- Phase 2
  - Structure the insect data for deep learning-based 3D classification (sort, scale, etc.).
  - Implement the same deep learning-based classification models for the insect dataset as used for the MedNIST
  - Implement one or more improved deep learning models for the insect dataset
  - Verify the data by applying network visualisation to insect model
 
## TODOs
- Create requirement file (soo all our envs are the same)
- Make sure all have acess to HPC and know how to use it
- Create a problem description
